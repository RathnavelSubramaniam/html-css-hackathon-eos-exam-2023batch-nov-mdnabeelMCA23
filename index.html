        <h1>Introduction to Wildlife</h1>
        <p>Wildlife comprises all living organisms (plants, animals, micro-organisms) in their natural habitats which are neither cultivated/domesticated nor tamed. But in its strictest sense, it includes uncultivated mammals, reptiles, birds and fishes etc. which are generally hunted.
            “Wildlife includes any animal, bees, butterflies, crustacea, fish and moths; and aquatic or land vegetation which form part of any habitat”.

In this definition, the word “animal” has come which according to the same Act means “Animals includes amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and their young, and also includes in the cases of birds and reptiles, their eggs.” 


Again in the same definition, the word “habitat” has come which according to the same Act means “Habitat includes land, water or vegetation which is the natural home of any wild animal.”
