                <h1>More Information about WildLife</h1>
                <p>Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife was also synonymous to game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities.[2] Some wildlife threaten human safety, health, property, and quality of life. However, many wild animals, even the dangerous ones, have value to human beings. This value might be economic, educational, or emotional in nature.

                    Humans have historically tended to separate civilization from wildlife in a number of ways, including the legal, social, and moral senses. Some animals, however, have adapted to suburban environments. This includes such animals as feral cats, dogs, mice, and rats. Some religions declare certain animals to be sacred, and in modern times, concern for the natural environment has provoked activists to protest against the exploitation of wildlife for human benefit or entertainment.</p>

                <p>Human-wildlife interaction is a broad and complex topic. Due to rapid world population growth, there have been greater human impacts on wildlife through agriculture and land fragmentation. In many countries, significant challenges exist with managing wildlife and its negative impacts on humans and wildlife. This special issue discusses human-wildlife co-existence.
                    Every year, several Mugger crocodile attacks are reported in Gujarat, claiming several human lives. But its districts have caught media attention, not because of the attacks but due to the positive relationship between the locals and the crocodiles. Communities are known to protect the mugger crocodiles actively and even build them small islands in the village ponds, despite the danger they pose. Researchers Anirudhkumar Vasava from Voluntary Nature Conservancy, Gujarat, and Simon Pooley from Birkbeck University of London, UK, met with the locals to understand how this coexistence came to be. They quickly realised that studying coexistence is no easy task. Observing the challenges, they have explored the need to shift how we think and study human-wildlife relationships in an essay in the journal Conservation Biology. 

                    Travelling around the districts of Kheda, Anand and Vadodara in Gujarat, the researchers interviewed people who had been bitten or were involved in human-crocodile conflicts. The locals often avoided their questions about the crocodile attacks or provided evasive answers. Moreover, communicating and translating their questions often proved to be challenging.

                    <p>Many Indian species are descendants of species originating in Gondwana, of which India originally was a part. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards, and collision with, the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism in the Deccan Traps and climatic change 20 million years ago caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms.[5] Soon thereafter, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes on either side of the emerging Himalayas.[6] As a result, among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians[1] Notable endemics are the Nilgiri langur and the brown and carmine Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India harbours 172, or 2.9%, of IUCN-designated threatened species.[7] India is located at the junction of three biogeographic realms: the Afrotropical, Indomalayan and Palearctic, and therefore, has characteristic elements from each of them, spurring migration of avifauna from these regions.</p>

                    <p>Deer are a common sight in suburban neighborhoods, farms, forests, and unfortunately, along roadways, where deer/vehicle collisions all too frequently occur. Deer populations are managed primarily through regulated hunting. An average mature whitetail can provide about 50 lbs of lean, healthy venison. That’s a lot of healthy, organic meat! If you know how to cook venison, you will agree that you can’t beat this delicious meat.
                        Lately, there’s interest in ‘all things local’ when it comes to food. Hunters embracing this ‘locavore’ lifestyle value their venison steaks, tenderloin, and burger more than the prospect of a buck’s trophy antlers. And they enjoy the unique challenge of bringing food from field to the table.  
                        
                        Hunting is the perfect activity for those interested in the ethic of a light ecological footprint. Free-range animals don’t require any of the resources commercial food operations do; wild animals don’t need feed, fertilizer, or antibiotics to grow, or the fuel required to ship them to your local grocery store. They literally live in your backyard.   </p>
